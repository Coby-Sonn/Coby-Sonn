## Hi there 👋

- After almost 6 years of experience as an Account Manager, and as a tech-savvy person I decided to pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Tel Aviv   University.
- 🎓 During that time, I have completed some mind opening and interesting courses.
- 🥇 One of the highlights of my time at TAU has to be winning the 2024 Computer Science Hackathon, focued on CrisisTech. Be sure to take a look at Ezra-Offline-SOS, any questions? I'd be happy to explain.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Computer Science degree at Tel Aviv University.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning both Computer Science and Business Administration.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Basketball is my favorite sport!
