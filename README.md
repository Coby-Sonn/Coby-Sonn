## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- After almost 6 years of experience as an Account Manager, I decided to follow my dream, and as a tech-savvy person I have decided to pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Tel Aviv   University.
- ðŸŽ“ During that time, I have completed some incredible and interesting courses.
- ðŸ¥‡ One of the highlights of my time at TAU has to be winning the 2024 Computer Science Hackathon, focued on CrisisTech. Be sure to take a look at Ezra-Offline-SOS, any questions? I'd be happhy to explain.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Computer Science degree at Tel Aviv University.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning both Computer Science and Business Administration.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Basketball is my favorite sport!
