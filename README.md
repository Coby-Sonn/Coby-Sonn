# Hi there, I'm Coby! 👋

I’m a tech enthusiast transitioning from a few years long career in Account Management to pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science at Tel Aviv University. Here's a bit more about me:

👨‍💻 Currently working on my own app! Still in stealth but I can say it's built using React Native - a language I decided to challenge myself and learn by developing a social media like solution with some advanced features. 

🎓 Academic Journey: Currently advancing my studies in Computer Science and Business Administration at TAU. I've delved into exciting courses, exploring everything from algorithms to data structures and beyond.

🥇 Hackathon Champion: Proud winner of the 2024 Tel Aviv University Computer Science Hackathon focused on Crisis-Tech. My team’s project caught attention, and we've since been accepted into a startup accelerator, where we're continuously evolving our product and company.

🚀 Startup Adventure: Passionate about turning ideas into reality, I’m working on our startup’s growth, combining tech and business strategy.

🌱 Lifelong Learner: Always eager to learn new things, from tech innovations to business strategies, and trying to keep pace with the latest industry trends. That's why I decided to develop my own app, and why I tend to share guides on how to overcome challenges I already had. Take a look at my Medium blog post about building Navigation the correct way. 

🏀 Fun Fact: I'm a basketball fan—it’s my favorite sport! Whether playing or watching, I’m always up for some hoops.

Feel free to connect or reach out for collaboration opportunities. Let’s build something cool together!
